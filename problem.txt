Carolyn:
I'd like to reconsider how we're handling cases where there is an inconsistent perspective-sentence pair
for instance, (addressee, "You are coming to X")
this pair is not true in any world according to the conventional semantics for "come"
which requires the perspective holder to be located at the destination of motion
right now we say that this is true if the addressee is located at X
but this is really a hack and I'm gettting more and more worried about it
Partly because this is actually an important issue that RSA models need to be able to handle
so far it seems like the RSA models have been able to dodge the question of what happens when you have a sentence that is not true in any of the worlds in the Common Ground
But we know that this happens: logical fallacies or contractions
But also any time when the worlds in the common ground are inconsistent with the utterance
This will arise if the speaker contradicts something previously uttered
But also if the addressee wrongly assumes some shared knowledge
I worry that a semanticist would really tear apart our model because it can't handle these cases
And I think it's a serious problem for our "come" data
our hack allows a perspective-holder to serve as the anchor for their own UT motion
which technically means that they can always anchor their own motion 
and therefore, trivially use "come" to describe their own motion regardless of the destination
So I really think we need to think about alternative solutions (sorry for the long text passage)

Brian:
what exactly is the problem with using come to describe one’s own motion using ‘come’, do you think?
depending on your answer to that, i can imagine several ways of responding.
like, maybe we just don’t have enough structure in the model yet to model that kind of issue (i.e. if it’s a presupposition failure or similar)
in which case setting it by fiat and acknowledging the limitations of our issue seems wise

however, if the constraint that rules out self-directed come is something we can naturally express in the model, then i think you are right to worry and we should try our best to implement the constraint

Carolyn:
The problem is that we won't be able to model the inferences that arise.
One of the basic facts we want to capture is that if I say, "I'm coming to NY tomorrow",
you (the addressee) infer either that I'm located in NY now, or that I think you're located in NY, or that I think you will be located in NY tomorrow.
If I can say "I'm coming to NY" any time I'm moving to NY, so long as I select a self-anchor, then you have no reason to draw an inference about my beliefs about your location (or my UT location).
At first I was thinking this problem would get solved once we introduce temporal indexing on perspective, but that's not the case. If we add a time index on perspective, this problem will still arise when we select speaker@UT as the perspective and the sentence "I'm coming to Northampton (right now)."
It's not exactly a presupposition failure, because the speaker's utterance is consistent with the Common Ground. The problem is just that when the addressee is enumerating over possible perspectives that the speaker might be adopting, some of those perspectives are going to be inconsistent with the utterance.
