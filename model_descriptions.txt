Model descriptions:

NEW DEFAULT:
Basic, sample perspective before utterance:
sample_p_1st.wppl
defines a set of utterances consistent with each perspective and only samples from that set during the Pragmatic Speaker computation
includes 'walk' in utterance set
takes cost setting as a cmdline arg
takes gop or nogop as a cmdline arg
takes 'speaker' as a cmdline arg to call Pragmatic Speaker instead of Pragmatic Listener
Bash scripts for listener: run_nogop.sh, run_gop.sh, run_probgop.sh
Bash script for speaker: run_speaker_all.sh

Basic, sample perspective before utterance, just come/go:
simple_p_1st.wppl
defines a set of utterances consistent with each perspective and only samples from that set during the Pragmatic Speaker computation
utterance set is only 'come'/'go'
takes cost setting as a cmdline arg
takes gop or nogop as a cmdline arg
takes 'speaker' as a cmdline arg to call Pragmatic Speaker instead of Pragmatic Listener
Bash script for listener: run_simple.sh
Bash script for speaker: none

Basic, heavily biased towards speaker perspective:
irrational_speaker.wppl
defines a set of utterances consistent with each perspective and only samples from that set during the Pragmatic Speaker computation
perspective prior heavily weighted towards speaker (10:1)
takes cost setting as a cmdline arg
takes gop, nogop, or prob as a cmdline arg
takes 'speaker' as a cmdline arg to call Pragmatic Speaker instead of Pragmatic Listener
Bash script for listener: none
Bash script for speaker: run_irr_speaker.sh

Basic, listener perspective cost:
lcost.wppl
Perspective cost in listener as well as speaker
defines a set of utterances consistent with each perspective and only samples from that set during the Pragmatic Speaker computation
takes cost setting as a cmdline arg
takes gop, nogop, or prob as a cmdline arg
takes 'speaker' as a cmdline arg to call Pragmatic Speaker instead of Pragmatic Listener
Bash script for listener: none
Bash script for speaker: run_lcost.sh

Sampled perspective cost:
sample_p_1st_ucost.wppl
defines a set of utterances consistent with each perspective and only samples from that set during the Pragmatic Speaker computation
Perspective cost is sampled within literalSpeaker
includes 'walk' in utterance set
takes gop or nogop as a cmdline arg
takes 'speaker' as a cmdline arg to call Pragmatic Speaker instead of Pragmatic Listener
Bash script for listener: run_ucost.sh
Bash script for speaker: none

Non-even world probabilities:
noneven_p_1st.wppl
defines a set of utterances consistent with each perspective and only samples from that set during the Pragmatic Speaker computation
Worlds are weighted to prefer speaker and listener in the same place
includes 'walk' in utterance set
takes cost setting as a cmdline arg
takes gop or nogop as a cmdline arg
takes 'speaker' as a cmdline arg to call Pragmatic Speaker instead of Pragmatic Listener
Bash script for listener: run_nonu.sh
Bash script for speaker: none

Old basic, just come/go:
xnew.wppl
utterance set is only 'come'/'go'
takes cost setting as a cmdline arg
must comment or uncomment gop or nogop
NOTE: method of dealing with inconsistent utterance/perspective pairs may be outdated

Basic, including walk:
xnew_prog_aug.wppl
includes 'walk' in utterance set
takes cost setting as a cmdline arg
must comment or uncomment gop or nogop
NOTE: method of dealing with inconsistent utterance/perspective pairs may be outdated

Lexical uncertainty model:
xnew_lexuncertain_aug.wppl
lexical uncertainty over gop or nogop (uniform dist)
includes 'walk' in utterance set
takes cost setting as a cmdline arg
NOTE: method of dealing with inconsistent utterance/perspective pairs may be outdated

Basic, false world:
xnew_aug.wppl
includes a false world in the world set
UNCLEAR IF THIS WORKS: method of dealing with inconsistent utterance/perspective pairs may not work
includes 'walk' in utterance set
takes cost setting as a cmdline arg
must comment or uncomment gop or nogop
