In a walk/go/come model with anti-perspectival semantics for go:
+ If Thera is the mover:
	- If the speaker but not the listener are in Noho:
		"Thera is coming to Northampton" becomes the most likely sentence as a function of speaker-bias
		"Thera is going" becomes less likely than "Thera is walking" as a function of speaker-bias
	- If the speaker and listener are in Noho:
		"Thera is coming" is likeliest
	- If neither are in Noho:
		"Thera is going" is much likelier than "Thera is walking"

	- Marginalizing over perspective:
		"Thera is coming" favors world in which both are at location
		"Thera is going" favors world in which neither are
		"Thera is walking" is equally likely in all worlds in which Thera is the mover

In a model with plain semantics for go:
+ If Thera is the mover:
	- If the speaker but not the listener are in Noho:
		"Thera is coming to Northampton" becomes the most likely sentence as a function of speaker-bias
		"Thera is going" is equally likely as "Thera is walking"
	- If the speaker and listener are in Noho:
		"Thera is coming" is likeliest
	- If neither are in Noho:
		"Thera is going" and "Thera is walking" are equally likely

	- Marginalizing over perspective:
		"Thera is coming" favors world in which both are at location
		"Thera is going" and "Thera is walking" favor world in which neither are at location, but are almost as likely in all worlds in which Thera is the mover
